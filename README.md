# STEM-Salaries

STEM is one of the fastest growing data fields in the world and is also necessary for growing the economy. Their jobs are in high demand but usually suffer from a lack of qualified candidates. The project focuses on different job positions in the STEM field. The main objective of this project is to compare the salary among different organizations for the same role and to identify if there is a gender disparity.

I started by extracting the data from csv file using Pandas in Python. I cleaned and restructured the raw data using the Numpy library. I then performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to see the correlation of different columns with total yearly compensation. After this, I ran different models using the sklearn library. From the models, I found out that the companies tend to pay higher salary to external candidates in comparison to the internal ones. There was a clear trend difference between developed and developing countries with US emerging as the leader. Also, there was a gender inequality in workforce in STEM related jobs. From these insights, I recommended that as a female candidate, it is more probable to secure a job in the US than rest of the world.
